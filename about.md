Hey, my name is Kennedy Sigauke. I am a software developer from Johannesburg, South Africa. I am passionate about 
building software that impacts and betters people's lives. I dabble a lot in Javascript, Ruby and Ruby on Rails. In
my free time I play guitar as a hobby and read books about software development.
